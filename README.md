# Dish: Something Yummy

Dish: Something Yummy is a "what's-in-your-fridge"-like web application with a twist. The application accepts an image of an ingredient or dish the user finds appetizing, populates a list of descriptors, and then generates a handful of recipes based on the user's selected descriptor.

This app was developed using with `React` & `Redux` in the frontend, `Express` & `Sequelize` in the backend, and with the help of Clarifai's image recognition API and Edamam's recipe search API. Fullstack Academy's boilermaker code was used as a base.

Running 'npm run start-dev' will start the development server.
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client` will run the server and `webpack` separately.
